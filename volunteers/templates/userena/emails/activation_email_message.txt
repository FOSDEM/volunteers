After activating, too work together efficiently, we could really use a 
recognisable id photo, a mobile phone number, and tasks you will work on.
Please after signing up, add your photo id and mobile phone number at https://
volunteers.fosdem.org/volunteers//edit/ (signin required)
Please also pick your tasks at https://volunteers.fosdem.org/tasks (signin
required)
No idea which task to pick? The slots with the highest priority for us to fill
are, in order of importance.: * any unfilled infodesk K slots * any unfilled
Friday buildup or Sunday cleanup slots * any heralding slots with no volunteers
yet (including lightning talks heralding) * any cloak room slot with no
volunteers yet * any Signage Placement slot, especially if the task has half or
less the needed number of volunteers * any video slot * any other slot
Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or remarks you might
have at volunteers@fosdem.org or +32 27 88 74 72 during the event.

P.S. We are very much aware of the responsibility that comes with asking you
for privacy sensitive information like photo id and mobile phone number. We use
it extremely carefully and sparingly, and obviously for FOSDEM only.
