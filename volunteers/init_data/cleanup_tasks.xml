        <description>
This is for Group A volunteers who want to help with early cleanup tasks.

This is a very important task. The more the merrier (and quicker we finish). We need to turn the FOSDEM venue back into a university and return the campus how we found it. 
There will be many tasks: taking down stands, removing brown paper from walls, collecting cables, removing signs, general tidying up, etc. While carrying heavy stuff around is sometimes required, other work requires a more delicate touch.
Dinner will be provided. Normally we're finished around 9pm, but we stay until we're done.
