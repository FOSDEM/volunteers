IMPORTANT! Please sign up for only one buildup task, which will help us know how many people are arriving when. 

Buildup is a very important task. The more the merrier (and quicker we finish). We need to turn the university campus into the FOSDEM venue. This is a great task for first-time volunteers, as you will get to know the conference, the volunteers and the staff very well.
There are many jobs to do: setting up stands, covering the wall with the famous brown paper, running cables, putting up signs, etc. While carrying heavy stuff around is sometimes required, other work requires a more delicate touch.
Lunch and dinner will be provided. As you can imagine, this is a mammoth task, and more volunteers are always wanted. So if you can't make it at 12:00, come a little later. There will be enough work to do to keep you busy, don't worry!
