Runners are the flexible support team for FOSDEM. You'll help with various tasks throughout the day as needs arise - delivering messages, assisting with crowd control, helping speakers, supporting other volunteer teams, and generally being available where extra hands are needed.
This is a great role for people who like variety and want to see different parts of the conference. You'll be on your feet and moving around the venue quite a bit, so comfortable shoes are essential.
Good problem-solving skills and a helpful attitude make this role successful.
