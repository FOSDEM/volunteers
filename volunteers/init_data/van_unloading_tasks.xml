IMPORTANT! This task is not at the ULB, but at our office (Kortenberg, walking distance from the train station). Address will be provided to those that sign up.

Help us unload all our equipment from two vans (no stairs, but lots of walking) and stack it in our storage rooms. After a successful FOSDEM, we need to return all materials to our storage facility.
Dinner will be provided.
