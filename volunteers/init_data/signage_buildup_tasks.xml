IMPORTANT! This task is outdoors.

Many of our visitors rely on our extra signage outside to navigate the campus. However, we need a brave group of volunteers to put this up on Friday during the build-up (this is why it is a separate task).
You'll be working outside in whatever weather conditions February brings, so dress appropriately. We'll be placing directional signs, banners, and wayfinding materials around the campus perimeter and key outdoor locations.
This task involves walking around the campus, carrying signs, and some light installation work. Good sense of direction and ability to follow a map are helpful.
Lunch and dinner will be provided.
