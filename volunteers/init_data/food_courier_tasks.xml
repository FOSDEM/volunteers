Help coordinate and deliver food to volunteers working at various stations throughout the venue. This is a great way to support fellow volunteers and ensure everyone stays energized throughout the day.
You'll be picking up food orders and distributing them to volunteer stations, infodesk teams, and other key locations around the campus. Good knowledge of the venue layout is helpful but not required.
This task involves walking around the venue and carrying food containers, so comfortable shoes are recommended.
