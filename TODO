# Volunteers TODO

## Once logged in, a volunteer or staff member should be able to:

- [x] change their personal data (name, email)
- [x] change the kind of tasks they're interested in (preferably with checkboxes, model TaskCategory)
- [x] see all available tasks (model Task), but grouped in two boxes: on top the tasks from categories they've selected, at the bottom tasks in other categories, so they know what else is available
- [x] assign and remove themselves to/from tasks
- [x] see how many volunteers are needed and how many are assigned to any task, show understaffed tasks in red (in the two lists from previous item)
- [x] select talks they're interested in attending, from a list grouped by the tracks and ordered by start time within the tracks, tracks ordered by start time as well (models Talk and Track)
- [x] see the moderation tasks for talks they're attending in a different color, so it's clear these are good targets of opportunity
- [x] eventually, be able to print out their schedule; HTML or PDF (or both)
- [x] print the schedule of anyone in the system, through their profile page. That way people can print out schedules for friends withoug requiring their login credentials.
- [x] have access to detail page for tasks with nicely formatted info and overview of who's signed up
- [ ] sign up from there as well
- [ ] view mugshots of other assignees there as well
- [x] have access to detail page for talks with nicely formatted info and overview of who's attending
- [ ] mark their attendance there as well
- [ ] view mugshots of other attendees there as well
- [x] see the people assigned to a task (friends like to do things together) - implemented as tooltip
- [x] see the the tasks a user has assigned himself to, on his profile (friends like to do things together)
- [ ] print schedules for entire task templates (handy for staff members, to get an overview of "their" volunteers)
- [ ] get an overview of who's supposed to be where for any given date/time, default to "now"
- [ ] do anything else I might have overlooked

## Some constraints and general functionality:
- [ ] text in the tool is entered using newlines, they should be converted to <br/> tags when displayed
- [ ] no more need for onhover task/talk descriptions now that we have detail pages
- [ ] tasks should display the description of their category, followed by the description of their task template, followed by their own. That way we can prevent data duplication by only listing specific info/overrides on the lower hierarchical level descriptors.
- [ ] users should not be able to select tasks that overlap (Dr. Manhattan detector)
- [x] first and last name are mandatory when signing up
- [ ] synchronization with pentabarf needs to be built in, so we don't need to keep tracks/talks updated manually
- [ ] this requires aligning the data model for talks/tracks more with pentabarf's data model, and adding rooms etc.
- [ ] staff members should automatically be granted access through SSO (Juan has example code for another tool that can be adapted)
- [ ] volunteers should get a notification when tasks they're assigned to, or talks they're attending (or for which they're assigned to a task) change substantially when synchronized against pentabarf

## The layout is currently very basic and ugly. The general layout should:
- [x] have the links at the top
- [x] keep some space for the FOSDEM logo that's still to be uploaded
- [x] keep the interface clean and simple

## Selection of 2many fields should happen via selection boxes as they're more accessible than multi-select lists. The tasks selection already works like that but has two problems:

- [x] When viewing the tasks page, the previously selected tasks are not selected. The values are stored in the DB, but the form doesn't display the previous selection.
- [ ] When saving the selection, the old one is cleared and the new one stored. Maybe an update would be a better and more efficient approach?
- [ ] Even better, and would obsolete the above, make a toggle button that takes immediate effect so the save button is not necessary, and Dr. Manhattan detection can happen earlier.



# Remarks from Mark:

## Front page:
- [x] fix page title: 'fostemers management" -> "FOSDEM 2014: Make it happen! volunteer!" (or something similarly descriptive)
- [ ] always visible: mailing list info, Juan & Mark contact info (you can also add my phone number there, don't know about Juan)

### Not logged in:
 - [ ] short call to action. example, loosely adapted from the call for action:"FOSDEM 2014(link) needs your help as a volunteer. From Friday noon 20140131 at 12:00 until Sunday 20140202 at 1:00, an enthusiastic band of volunteers helps us make FOSDEM a fun and safe place for all visitors. We can't do this without you. We need as many hands as possible, especially during buildup and teardown. Do you have some spare time during weekend? Would you like to be a part of the team that makes FOSDEM tick?"
 - [ ] big central basic signup form. Think like the one at https://basecamp.com/
 - [ ] drop as much of the other content as possible. it distracts from the message
### At first login after email confirmation:
 - [ ] complete your user profile (see below)

## User profile:
- [x] We need a mobile phone number in the user profile. This has been discussed in the past and proven invaluable. Some explanation why we need it would be most appropriate. => we need to be able to quickly contact volunteers in case of emergencies.
- [ ] STILL DISCUSSING; PERSONALLY I DISAGREE WITH MARK. I LIKE THE CAREFREE LANGUAGE USED IN THE TOOL. Mugshot is really useful. I would give it a more descriptive label though, like "ID photo". This also _really_ need some explanation why we want it: Staff and volunteers need to be able to quickly recognise people they've never worked before with during the event.
- [ ] Only main language is mentioned. I'd love to see a list of languages that is easy to tick off for the most common ones. Somewhat in order of usefullness: en, fr, de, nl, es. Maybe a dropdown for less common ones? Minor wishlist request. Let's  not forget minority languages (Catalan, Basque, ...) => agree, but not necessarily with the specific implementation proposed. See my mail about how the search field works in OpenERP V7, or following link: http://v6.openerp.com/node/1269#h.s32sfkfbqa0q. Also, that was the i18n language selection, not the volunteers languages; it's been removed, we need to add language list to the tool.
- [x] Minor nitpick: "teardown" is before "buildup" in the list task at hand. => Already mentioned above; this list needs to be ordered chronologically.
- [ ] Tasks need some n => Waiting for Mark to finish that sentence. ;)
- [ ] STILL DISCUSSING; PERSONALLY I DISAGREE WITH MARK. Profiles should be as public as possible, to make communication at the conf as easy as possible:
 1. public by default (with some warning explaining why!)
 2. volunteers and staff only (also printed lists at the event!)
 3. visible to admins only
